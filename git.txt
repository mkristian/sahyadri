;; This buffer is for notes you don't want to save, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; If you want to create a file, visit that file with C-x C-f,
;; then enter the text in that file's own buffer.

well then you need to learn how to push your changes to github
first make $ git status
to see what has changed
then $ git diff or $ git diff app/views
to see the changes and then add your files with 
$ git add app/views/...
and then you need to commit the added files
$ git commit # add some remark about what you made with those files
and to push the code
$ git push
